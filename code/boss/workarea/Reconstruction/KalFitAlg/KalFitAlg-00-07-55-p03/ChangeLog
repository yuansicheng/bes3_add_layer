         *           (2) the definition of the forward and the backward

	 * Well, we should be attention that the logical volume's name
	 * used in KalFitAlg need keep the same with BesSim.

2008-05-30 Wang Jike
         * added two files:
	 * (1) ReadGdml.cxx, all the material used in Kalman Track
	 * fitting get from file Mdc.gdml and Bes.gdml. The density
	 * , the inonization energy, the radlen can be get from G4
	 * calculation result directly. But for Z and A, when the 
	 * material is compound and mixture such as Mdcgas and Air,
	 * i can not get his Z and A from G4 directly. So i calculate
	 * the equivalent Z and A by myself, i sum all the compound
	 * or mixture's elements' Z or A multiple its fraction mass.
	 * I am not sure how G4 calculate these, it looks the same,
	 * the calculating code can be seen in file G4Material.cc

2008-04-16 Wang Jike<wangjk@ihep.ac.cn>
         * (1) for BESIII magnetic field, there are two kinds of Bz,
	 *  1.0T and 0.9T, which is determinated by different runmode,
	 *  so I also get the nominal B field value from magnetic field
	 *  service, then the nominal magnetic used in Sim and KalmanFit
	 *  can be the same all the time. 
	 * (2) As the class Helix in KalFitAlg package, also appear in other
	 *  packages such as TrkReo using the same class name, after I 
	 *  modified the class Helix,  this cause a segmentation break
	 *  problem during run. I still not quite understand the reason.
	 *  In order to avoid the conflict, namespace technique is used
	 *  in KalFitAlg package.

         * constructor the KalFitHitMdc object, but it is so strange that 
         * this can pass the gmake course .  This can cause a serious pro-
         * blem about piont

	* BesTimerSvc is used to evaluate CPU time per event/track
	* add more Ntuples and Hbooks
	* material and cylinder data updated
	* error matrix is initialized based on BESII results

2005-4-13  Da.yong WANG <wangdy@mail.ihep.ac.cn>

	* Ntuples and Hbooks added and run smoothly
	* begin to use the latest(permanent??) version of AsciiFile  

2005-4-8  Da.yong WANG  <wangdy@mail.ihep.ac.cn>

	* add clearTables() to clear MdcTables after each event:
	* after painstaking check,memory-related problem in fillTable_back()
	  is not solved, so we have to skip it at present
	* some detector parameters changed

	* implement fillTable_***() functions; still some bugs exist...

2005-3-25  Da.yong WANG <wangdy@mail.ihep.ac.cn>

	* initialize information of Mdc geometry and Bfield
	* material and cylinder information added through data files
	* CERNLIB used, instead of link options
	* many other detailed debugging and minor changes

2005-3-17  Da.yong WANG <wangdy@mail.ihep.ac.cn>

	* change the directory structure a little and cmt requirements
	* the first version successfully running (in Boss4.1.0)
	* retrieve data from TDS and construct MdcTables data	
	* first import this algorithm into BossCvs

2005-3-15  Da.yong WANG <wangdy@mail.ihep.ac.cn>

	* adjust this package partly, settle the minimal set of files
